# Farmville-Lite
For this project, I created a farming game inspired by the game FarmVille. Compared to the actual game, my game has limited features, where the user can only plant one of two types of seeds (wheat and saplings). There is also a point system, where players can keep track of the profits they have made from growing and harvesting plants. 

In the future, I hope to add more features to the game, possibly a market feature, where the coins can be spent.

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to run, and I used Python with packages from the Anaconda Distribution and the pygame module.
